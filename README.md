# Antaeus : Disaster Assistance Chatbot

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a chatbot designed to assist users in disaster-affected areas. The chatbot provides real-time damage detection and classification by analysing satellite imagery ,support, information, and connections to emergency services, helping to ensure safety and survival during critical times.

## Features
- **Emergency Alerts:** Notifications and updates about ongoing disasters in the userâ€™s vicinity.
- **Resource Finder:** Helps locate nearby shelters, hospitals, and relief centers.
- **Communication Assistance:** Facilitates communication with emergency contacts and services.
- **First Aid Guidance:** Provides step-by-step instructions for administering first aid.
- **Multilingual Support:** Communicates in multiple languages to reach diverse communities.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hamza-Bouali/Antaeus.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Antaeus
   ```

we recommend to use the kaggle notebook to run the backend server

## Usage
1. open the notebook inside the project (notebook.ipynb) and wait until it reaches the last cell of code.
2. select the url and then open the file App.jsx file , search for the varibale url ,and set it to the result. 
3. inside the directory there is a folder named front , open it with the terminal and run this commands
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Interact with the chatbot through the command line or web interface.

## Technologies Used
### Machine Learning & Deep Learning:
**Siamese Networks**: For the damage prediction model, we use a neural network architecture inspired by Siamese networks, which compares pre- and post-disaster images to predict damage levels.
**Computer Vision**: For disaster classification (e.g., hurricanes, floods, wildfires, earthquakes) based on satellite imagery, leveraging advanced image classification models.
**PyTorch**: This framework was used used to train and deploy the machine learning models.
**XBD Dataset**: The model training was done on the XBD dataset, a benchmark dataset for disaster damage detection in satellite imagery, provided by xview2.
